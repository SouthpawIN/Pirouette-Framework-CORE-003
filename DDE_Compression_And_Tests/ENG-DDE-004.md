summary: >
  Defines how RGBA dataset tiles are transformed into high-dimensional vectors,
  indexed (e.g. with FAISS), and exposed as a resonance-search surface. This
  layer turns DDE from a passive image archive into an active, autopoietic,
  AI-searchable memory.

# §1 · Purpose

The **Vectorization & Retrieval Layer** turns the entropy-balanced tiles from
ENG-DDE-003 into **queryable semantic objects**.  
It provides a fast ANN (approximate nearest neighbor) interface so that **any**
agent (human or AI) can say: “find me tiles like *this*” and get back the right
data — even though it’s stored as images.

This is the moment DDE stops being storage and becomes **memory**.

---

# §2 · Vector Construction

Given an image tile \( I \in \mathbb{R}^{s \times s \times 4} \),
we define a deterministic flatten → pool → normalize pipeline:

1. **Patch flattening**  
   Divide \(I\) into \(p \times p\) patches (e.g. 8×8, 16×16).
2. **Channel pooling**  
   For each patch, compute:
   \[
   v_{patch} = [\text{mean}(R), \text{mean}(G), \text{mean}(B), \text{mean}(A),
                \text{var}(R), \text{var}(G), \text{var}(B), \text{var}(A)]
   \]
3. **Concatenation**  
   Concatenate all patch vectors into one feature vector \(v \in \mathbb{R}^d\).
4. **Normalization**  
   \[
   \hat{v} = \frac{v}{\|v\|_2}
   \]
   to stabilize ANN distances.

Typical dimensionalities: **512–4096** depending on patching and channels.

# §3 · Indexing (FAISS)

Create a FAISS index:

```python
import faiss
d = len(vectors[0])
index = faiss.IndexIVFFlat(faiss.IndexFlatL2(d), d, 1024)
index.train(vectors)
index.add(vectors)
````

* **IVF** (inverted file) for large, distributed ecosystems
* **HNSW** optional for recall-critical scientific datasets
* **GPU-FAISS** preferred in RGBA contexts (we’re already on GPU for images)

Index metadata stores:

* tile_id
* source_dataset
* gulp_id
* encoding_version
* Dark Residue score (for ethical reranking)

---

# §4 · Resonance Retrieval

Instead of raw L2 only, DDE supports **resonance-weighted retrieval**:

[
d_{eff}(q, v) = \alpha \cdot d_{L2}(q, v) + \beta \cdot d_{entropy}(q, v) + \gamma \cdot d_{provenance}(q, v)
]

where

* (d_{entropy}) penalizes mismatched channel statistics,
* (d_{provenance}) pushes newer / locally-trusted tiles upward,
* (\alpha,\beta,\gamma) are set by the autopoietic governance loop.

This makes search **context aware** — two visually similar tiles can rank
differently if one is “cleaner” ethically.

---

# §5 · Query Modes

1. **Image → Image:** supply an RGBA tile, get nearest tiles.
2. **Descriptor → Image:** supply precomputed vector, get tiles.
3. **Semantic → Image:** supply label / ontology term → look up its canonical
   tile in DDE → run ANN on that vector.
4. **Ethical → Image:** supply a max Dark Residue budget → fetch only tiles
   below that budget.

---

# §6 · Provenance-Aware Reranking

Each FAISS hit is post-processed with the DDE ledger entry (from ENG-DDE-002):

```json
{
  "tile_id": "dde://2025/10/gulp_07/tile_003",
  "resonance": 0.942,
  "dark_residue": 1.9e-5,
  "source": "lab/sensor/A12",
  "created_at": "2025-10-30T22:12:00Z"
}
```

Reranking rule:
[
\text{score} = \lambda_r \cdot \text{resonance} - \lambda_d \cdot \mathcal{D} + \lambda_t \cdot \text{recency}
]

This is how **Pirouette ethics** actually affects **search results**.

---

# §7 · Integration with Pirouette Coherence

This layer exports a **resonance surface** to the Pirouette engine:

* Coherence analyzers can sample the FAISS index to detect topic clusters.
* Debate engines (DYNA-002) can fetch evidence tiles for or against a claim.
* Dark Residue auditors can pull all high-ΔD tiles for review.

So DDE is not just *for* AI; it **feeds** the autopoietic loop.

# §9 · Summary

> ENG-DDE-004 is where data gains **locatability**.
> After this layer, a tile is not just stored — it can be *found*,
> *ranked*, and *judged* by both machines and humans.
