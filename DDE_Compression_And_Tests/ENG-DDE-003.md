# §1 · Purpose

The **Square Image Generator** is responsible for transforming RGBA-encoded
gulps into geometric tiles that maximize entropy uniformity and retrieval
efficiency.  
This process transforms the abstract encoding of **ENG-DDE-001** into
a physical, viewable “data cell” of the DDE organism.

Each tile represents a stable *information membrane* — an equilibrium
between compression, accessibility, and visual coherence.

---

# §2 · Algorithmic Design

Given an encoded gulp \( G \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times4} \),
the goal is to construct a square image \( I_{s\times s\times4} \)
with minimal padding and uniform color-space occupation.

\[
s = \lceil \sqrt{N} \rceil
\]
\[
I[x,y,:] = G[i,:] \quad \text{for } i = y\cdot s + x
\]

If \( N < s^2 \), remaining cells are filled with **resonant padding**:

\[
I_{pad} = \text{median}(G) + \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_{col}/100)
\]
ensuring continuity across the visual boundary.

---

# §3 · Fractal Symmetry Option

To reflect hierarchical datasets (e.g., relational tables, multilevel ontologies),
DDE supports **fractal layout encoding**:

\[
I_{fractal} = F_{k}(I_{base})
\]
where \(F_k\) is a recursive tiling function that subdivides each quadrant
according to entropy variance.  
This yields a “fractal atlas” where denser data regions gain finer pixel
representation.

---

# §4 · Entropy Equilibrium and Verification

Entropy is monitored both globally and locally:

\[
H_{global} = -\sum_{c\in\{R,G,B,A\}} p_c \log p_c
\]
\[
H_{local}(x,y) = H(\mathcal{N}_{r}(x,y))
\]

Equilibrium is achieved when:

\[
\frac{|H_{local} - H_{global}|}{H_{global}} < \epsilon_H
\]

Typical threshold: \( \epsilon_H = 0.05 \).

Images failing this check are re-tiled with alternate symmetries (spiral,
Peano–Hilbert, or Voronoi patching) until the balance criterion is met.

# §5 · Color Mapping and Accessibility

To preserve human interpretability and ensure aesthetic legibility
in visualization tools:

- Each channel may be gamma-corrected:
  \[
  C' = (C / 255)^{1/\gamma_{vis}} \cdot 255
  \]
- Default \( \gamma_{vis} = 2.2 \).
- Optional perceptual remapping into CIELAB for ethical presentation layers,
  ensuring no bias in human labeling or interpretation tasks.

---

# §6 · Provenance Layer (Alpha Channel)

The **A-channel** carries provenance codes:
\[
A = 255 \cdot \frac{i}{N}
\]
where \( i \) is the cell index.  
This acts as a “time gradient” across the tile, allowing reconstruction of
ingestion order, even when tiles are shuffled across distributed nodes.

# §7 · Validation and Falsifiability

| Test | Metric | Expected |
|:-----|:--------|:----------|
| Shape integrity | \( s^2 \ge N \) | ✓ |
| Entropy equilibrium | \( |H_{local}-H_{global}|/H_{global} < 0.05 \) | ✓ |
| Round-trip reconstruction | Δ checksum | 0 |
| Human accessibility | Δ color bias | < 2 % across CIELAB channels |

# §8 · Example Workflow

```python
from dde_core import encode_to_RGBA, build_square_image

encoded = encode_to_RGBA("data.csv")
image = build_square_image(encoded, fractal=True, entropy_tolerance=0.05)
image.save("dataset_tile.png")
````

Resulting output:

* 512×512 RGBA tile (reversible)
* Embedded provenance channel
* Balanced entropy across all four color planes

---

# §9 · Ethical and Aesthetic Integration

* **Visual Ethics:** Prevent perceptual dominance of any feature space.
* **Computational Ethics:** Reduce redundancy without removing meaning.
* **Thermodynamic Altruism:** Tile generation that minimizes energy and
  attention cost while maximizing reversibility and beauty.
