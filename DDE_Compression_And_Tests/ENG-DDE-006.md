# §1 · Purpose

The **Ecosystem Resonance Interface (ERI)** allows DDE data to participate in
Pirouette’s **coherence calculus** — where information is not just stored or
retrieved, but measured for how harmoniously it fits within the evolving body of
knowledge.

ERI transforms the DDE from a data warehouse into a **participant in debate**:
each image, vector, or manifest becomes a voice that can resonate, contradict,
or reinforce other data in the autopoietic dialogue.

---

# §2 · Core Mechanism

ERI maps FAISS vectors \( v_i \) from **ENG-DDE-004** into Pirouette’s
coherence space via a transformation:

\[
\Psi_i = \mathcal{R}(v_i) = [\Gamma_i, K_i, T_{a,i}, \mathcal{D}_i]
\]

where:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| \( \Gamma_i \) | geometric resonance weight (derived from entropy gradients) |
| \( K_i \) | stiffness or local curvature proxy |
| \( T_{a,i} \) | temporal adherence (update rate) |
| \( \mathcal{D}_i \) | Dark Residue score from provenance table |

The resulting 4-tuple allows each tile to enter Pirouette’s **resonance algebra**.

---

# §3 · Resonance Mapping

1. Compute local resonance:
   \[
   R_i = \frac{1}{N}\sum_j \exp(-d_{eff}(v_i, v_j)^2 / \sigma^2)
   \]
   where \( d_{eff} \) is the resonance-weighted distance from **ENG-DDE-004**.
2. Normalize across the ecosystem:
   \[
   \bar{R}_i = \frac{R_i - \min(R)}{\max(R)-\min(R)}
   \]
3. Feed normalized \( \bar{R}_i \) into the Pirouette coherence engine as the
   tile’s participation amplitude.

This allows coherence maps to visualize which tiles “sing in tune” and which
create dissonance.

# §4 · Debate Coupling (DYNA-002 Integration)

ERI exports a live data bus:
```yaml
topic: coherence_update
payload:
  id: <tile_id>
  resonance: <R_i>
  dark_residue: <D_i>
  argument_link: <graph_edge>
````

The debate engine (DYNA-002) subscribes to this feed to:

* surface empirical evidence during discussions,
* automatically pull representative data for or against a proposition,
* evaluate argument entropy using live DDE resonance metrics.

Thus, a scientific debate can literally **hear** what the data think.

---

# §5 · Ethical Feedback Loop

Through **PHIL-THERMOALTR-001**, each resonance event updates global
thermodynamic altruism metrics:

[
\Delta \mathcal{A} = - \frac{\partial \mathcal{D}}{\partial t}
]

A decrease in systemic Dark Residue ((\mathcal{D})) corresponds to an increase
in coherence altruism ((\mathcal{A})).
ERI thereby becomes a *moral modulator*: it quantifies when dataset usage
improves or degrades the world’s informational harmony.

# §6 · Governance Hooks

| Event                  | Trigger   | Action                                 |
| :--------------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------- |
| New data tile added    | ingestion | Register in ERI & announce resonance   |
| Resonance drop > 0.2   | detection | Flag tile for review or retraining     |
| Dark Residue spike     | audit     | Send to ethics council for pruning     |
| Stable coherence > 0.9 | milestone | Promote dataset to “lighthouse” status |

These events feed directly into Pirouette’s governance module (LAW-AUTOPOI-001)
for systemic steering.

# §9 · Summary

> ENG-DDE-006 is the *conversation bridge* between matter and meaning.
> Through it, datasets become participants in dialogue, guided by coherence,
> accountable by Dark Residue, and harmonized within the Pirouette chorus.
