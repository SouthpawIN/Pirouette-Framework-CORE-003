summary: >
  Defines the autopoietic ingestion process by which datasets are chunked into
  statistically balanced gulps, encoded into RGBA form, and streamed into the
  Distributed Database Ecosystem (DDE).  The protocol mirrors biological digestion:
  sample → normalize → encode → deposit → metabolize.

# §1 · Purpose

The **Gulp-Based Ingestion Protocol** governs how raw datasets are parsed,
normalized, and transformed into RGBA-encoded tiles for inclusion in the
ecosystem.  The name _gulp_ recalls the biological metaphor: a system takes
small bites of information, digests them completely, and distributes the
nutrients (data vectors) across the network.

This protocol enables reproducible, incremental ingestion of large datasets
without centralized pre-processing.

---

# §2 · Conceptual Overview

Each dataset passes through four stages:

1. **Pre-Scan:** Determine column min/max, value counts, and entropy.
2. **Gulp Partitioning:** Slice dataset into `N` blocks with balanced
   statistical envelopes.
3. **Encoding:** Apply the hybrid RGBA encoder (ENG-DDE-001).
4. **Emission:** Stream encoded gulps into the DDE’s image cache and vector
   index.

All operations are idempotent and resumable.

# §3 · Algorithmic Flow

```python
def ingest_dataset(file_path, gulp_size=10000):
    stats = pre_scan(file_path)
    for i, gulp in enumerate(chunk_csv(file_path, gulp_size)):
        encoded = encode_to_RGBA(gulp, stats)
        store_image(encoded, meta=gulp.metadata)
        update_registry(i, gulp.hash, energy_cost(encoded))
````

* `pre_scan()` computes `μ, σ, H(S)` for each column.
* `encode_to_RGBA()` applies per-column normalization (ENG-DDE-001).
* `store_image()` writes to distributed cache (e.g., S3, IPFS, local node).
* `update_registry()` records provenance and Dark Residue metrics.

# §4 · Statistical Balancing

Gulps are not arbitrary slices but **entropy-equalized** partitions.

Let ( H_i ) be the Shannon entropy of gulp ( i ).
We define the **balance criterion**:

[
|H_i - \bar{H}| < \epsilon_H, \quad \text{with } \bar{H} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_i H_i.
]

If a gulp exceeds tolerance, it is rebalanced by adjusting row boundaries.

This ensures each encoded image tile carries equivalent informational weight,
stabilizing model training and FAISS indexing.

# §5 · Provenance and Energy Ledger

Each gulp produces a **provenance packet**:

```json
{
  "gulp_id": "2025-10-30T22:04:00Z",
  "rows": 10000,
  "entropy": 7.94,
  "energy_kWh": 0.002,
  "dark_residue": 2.3e-5,
  "checksum": "sha256:...",
  "previous": "gulp_id(n-1)"
}
```

Packets are stored in the **Ecosystem Ledger**, forming a blockchain-like
audit trail for reproducibility and energetic accountability.

# §6 · Autopoietic Behavior

The ingestion layer is self-tuning:

* Adjusts `gulp_size` based on network latency and GPU utilization.
* Prioritizes high-entropy gulps for early ingestion (richness-first).
* Feeds reconstruction feedback into later passes (learning metabolism).

Each iteration decreases systemic Dark Residue by improving encoding efficiency
and coherence alignment across gulps.

---

# §7 · Governance Integration

Through Pirouette’s autopoietic loop:

```
Draft → Debate → Ratify → Dictionary → Graph → Draft
```

* **Draft:** New dataset registered.
* **Debate:** Statistical properties compared to prior gulps.
* **Ratify:** Schema accepted and ingestion proceeds.
* **Dictionary:** Variable names added to ontology.
* **Graph:** Relationships visualized for coherence analysis.

The loop guarantees both technical and ethical ingestion fidelity.
